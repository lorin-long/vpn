## Project Info

Potatso has in total 33 (2 as submodules dependencies as used as local file in Cocoapod) dependencies as following

* 28 Cocoapod dependencies
* 1 Carthage dependency
* 4 submodules dependencies

The project is tested with Xcode `8.2 (8C38)` on iOS `10.2 (14C92)` device with cocoapod version `1.1.1`+, and carthage version `0.18.1`.  
If you experienced an expected issue, try to use those versions.

## Change log

You can take a look at [Change log](https://github.com/haxpor/Potatso/wiki/Change-log) for changes that has made for specific commit that has significant updates. Thus you can freely decide whether you want to rebuild Potatso to include such update or not.

## How to Build Project

Perform the following steps to be able to build the project.
Be warned that you **should not** call `pod update` as newer version of pod frameworks that Potatso depends on might break building process and there will be errors.

1. `git submodule update --init` to update git submodule
2. `pod install` to pull down dependencies into our project
3. `carthage update` to pull down dependencies into `Carthage/Checkouts` folder and build each one
4. Open `Potatso.xcworkspace` then Build and Run the project. Done.

## Build Notices

If you try to build for iOS 10.3, please try to use XCode Version 8.3 (8E162) onwards and only for release version.

## Code Notices

There're a couple of issues that needed to look at, but after testing, it does **not** affect the functionality of the app.

* In file `Potatso/Core/API.swift`, it's the following code focusing on line with comment that I can't figure it out yet how to migrate it to Swift 3 code.  

   ```swift
   var JSONToMap: AnyObject?
   if let keyPath = keyPath, keyPath.isEmpty == false {
       //JSONToMap = (result.value? as AnyObject).value(forKeyPath: keyPath)
       JSONToMap = nil
   } else {
       JSONToMap = result.value as AnyObject?
   }
   ```
* Potatso core code depends on version `1.7.0` of Eureka with manual migration to Swift 3. It's already done and linked to project. But you will see `observeValue()` function in `Eureka/Source/Rows/PostalAddressRow.swift` that has been commented for all of its function code due to Eureka's newer version `2.0.0-beta.1` doesn't include such file in the project anymore, but it still works with no problem. This note is meant to mark that there is going to be a lot of effort if we decide to depend on Eureka version `2.0.0-beta.1` as we need to change a lot of Potatso core code.
